    <p><b>~Opinion:</b></p>
    <p>As someone new to coding, the book seemed deliberately set out in a way that makes the code accessible to those without much prior exposure. It is organised in chapters but wasn't the kind of book you need to red cover to cover. You can pick it up, refer back to it, and skip to bits which are more relevant to your project. In this way, it is really useful as an ongoing source of information for someone learning HTML & CSS, and is a useful resource even when learning in a class or through online programs. It covers all of the material from elements to tables and forms, even beyond to markup and such. </p>
